                    <h1> The Legacy of David Thompson </h1>
                    <p>
                        In Canada and the United States there are many symbols that preserve the accomplishments of David Thompson, even if he didn’t receive such recognition for his efforts during his lifetime, his contributions are well-preserved in some areas today.  In Alberta, there is a highway that runs  across the province, which bears his name and traverses breathtaking scenery, it is home to many popular hikes and viewpoints scattered about the region, with many hikers, travellers, and aspiring adventurers coining the area as “Dave Thompson Country”.  There is no doubt that he once travelled those very lands, when the world was a much more quiet place.

                        The adventurer also receives credit and praise from Canadian folk singer Stan Rogers, who sings of Thompson as someone who carved a path through the rugged terrain of the Canadian wilderness.  He sings in thankfulness for the courage of those who explored the unknown, so that he could trace their steps and gain a sense of their adventure: 
“And through the night, behind the wheel, the mileage clicking west
I think upon Mackenzie, David Thompson and the rest
Who cracked the mountain ramparts and did show a path for me” (Rogers, 1981).
