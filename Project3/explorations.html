                    <h1> A Brief OVerview of his Explorations </h1>

                    <p>
                        Travelling at least 80,000 km throughout his life, Thompson is credited with mapping what is now eastern and northwestern portions of the United States, as well as the majority of the western part of modern day Canada (Gilmore, 2015).  With such skill and passion as to take every opportunity he could to survey, his maps were among the finest and most accurate to be produced for nearly the next century (HBC, 2016).  The petty and unfortunate treatment of Thompson by the HBC robbed him of the credit and compensation that he was owed, and if not for the likes of Joseph Burr Tyrell, we may not have his published journals and works so widely available today (HBC, 2016).

                        Phillip Turnor and a team were en route to the Athabasca area when he first met David Thompson who was still recovering from his broken leg, because of his injury, Thompson missed the opportunity to work with Turnor (HBC, 2016). Although, two years after receiving his designation as a clerk with the HBC, Thompson received an assignment to carry on with Turnor’s work, which unfortunately had to be postponed (HBC, 2016).  Although, by 1795, Thompson was instructed once again to carry on the Athabascan endeavour in which he would survey the muskrat region’s waterways, which turned out to be rather arduous to traverse with packed canoes (HBC, 2016).

                    <h2>Beginning at the North West Company </h2>
                    <p>
                        Upon his resignation at the HBC, David Thompson sought employment with the NWC, who were well aware of his skills and reputation and gladly hired him on and his initial task was to officially chart NWC trading settlements along the 49th parallel, which would later represent the majority of the Canada/US border (HBC, 2016).  Within the next two years, Thompson had mapped a path to link Grand Portage, the NWC’s head office to the Red river, and the Mississippi River, both of which he had surveyed in depth before charting the path (HBC, 2016).  During this time, he made an astute observation which would later be proven correct by a small margin of error, this observation was that the source of the Mississippi River was in fact Turtle Lake in modern north Minnesota (HBC, 2016).

                    <h2>Later Adventures with the North West Company </h2>
                    <p>
                        Following his marriage to Charlotte Small in 1799, both her and Thompson embarked on many expeditions that would successfully map much of the region to the east of the rockies, he would cover a great deal of land in the western and southern vicinity of the recently built settlement, Rocky Mountain House during the latter quarter of 1800 (HBC, 2016).  The following year, from Rocky Mountain House he reached the area that would later be home to the bustling city of Calgary, and also failed in his endeavour to traverse into the Rocky Mountains (HBC, 2016).

                    <h2> Overcoming the Rockies </h2>
                    <p>
                        It wasn’t until the spring of 1807 that Thompson, with his family in tow and a group of nine others decided to attempt to explore the Rocky Mountains again (HBC, 2016).  By the summer of that year, Thompson had traversed deep enough into the Rockies to establish the new settlement of Kootenae House on the southern end of what is today called Lake Windermere, it was here that they spent their winter (HBC, 2016).  The following spring signalled more adventure as Thompson would depart Kootenae house and follow the Kootenay River into what is now the United States, particularly, Idaho and Washington, he would later return to Kootenae house, and by the next year, he would return again to Montana and Idaho (HBC, 2016).  Before finally returning to the NWC, Thompson had explored an impressive amount of land, and encountered untold hazards and beauties.  Thompson was not one to turn down an opportunity to travel, and the quality of his work is truly proof that he was a passionate adventurer through and through.
