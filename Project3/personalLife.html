                    <h1>The Life of David Thompson</h1>

                    <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
                    <p>David Thompson was born in London, England on April 30, 1770 and would grow up to become one of the world’s most influential, accomplished cartographers and explorers (Gilmore, 2015).  Thompson was not born into wealth and according to Don Gilmore, as a young child he “attended the Grey Coat Hospital in London, a school for the poor and orphaned” (Gilmore, 2015).  He became an apprentice for the Hudson’s Bay Company[HBC] in 1784, which gave him employment at the historic York Factory settlement after working for one year out of a seven year term at Fort Churchill (Hudson’s Bay Company[HBC], 2016).  By his mid teens,  Thompson had begun to live an exciting and adventurous life beginning with his employment at the HBC and crossing the ocean to reach present day Churchill, Manitoba (Gilmore, 2015).  He would soon build up to traversing the largely untamed wilderness of North America.

                    <h2>First Travels</h2>
                    <p>
                        About 2 years into his term Thompson was relocated by the HBC once again,  and during this time inland, he encountered several First Nations peoples, from whom he would learn both the Cree and Blackfoot languages (HBC, 2016).  He would become very close with the Pikani people, who resided in the foothills of the rocky mountains, as he spent an entire winter living with them, in present day Alberta (Gilmore, 2015).  As mentioned in the archives of the Ontario Ministry of Government and Consumer Services, (with acknowledgement to the Crown Copyright granted by the Queen’s Printer for Ontario), during his time with the Pikani people (known today as Piegan), Thompson learned and recorded a great deal about their history and customs from chief Saukamappee(Ontario Ministry of Government and Consumer Services[OMGCS], 2015).

                    <p>
                        Today Thompson is known as one of the few European explorers who valued and closely observed the culture of the Indigenous people he encountered, his ability to speak multiple First Nations dialects(Gilmore, 2015), was a testament to this.  In the fierce competition of fur-trading companies, the First Nations peoples were given alcohol as a manipulative compensation for their participation in the fur trade, and according to McMillan and Yellowhorn, Thompson noted the unfortunate effects of, at times, rampant substance abuse in Indigenous populations as a result of this practise in 1785 (McMillan & Yellowhorn, 2004).

                    <h2>An Early Setback With a Silver Lining</h2>
                    <p>
                        While his experiences travelling for the HBC began with great adventure and experience, Thompson soon found himself significantly immobilized due to a sledding mishap in the final days of 1788 that left his right leg dreadfully broken(HBC, 2016).  After the unfortunate and tragic sledding incident at Manchester House, a settlement not far from the municipality of North Battleford, SK today, Thompson was due for a lengthy recovery and by the springtime of 1788, he had been moved to Cumberland House (HBC, 2016).  Cumberland House is now a Canadian National Historic Site in Saskatchewan, it is recognized as the HBC’s first interior fur-trading settlement (Canada’s Historic Places, n.d.).  As Thompson’s recovery progressed, he became educated and furthered his skills in surveying, math, and astronomy as a pupil of the HBC’s official surveyor Philip Turnor, whom he had become acquainted with in the winter after his accident (HBC, 2016).  Thompson became so immersed in learning astronomy that he lost sight in one eye, an unfortunate consequence of  overexposure to the sun, in his commitment to studying the sky (Gilmore, 2015).

                    <p>
                        Turnor noticed the improvement of Thompson’s skills and during 1790, he addressed a letter endorsing David Thompson’s potential as a surveyor, to the London committee, even including the work of Thompson as proof (HBC, 2016).  Turnor’s endorsement of Thompson has been preserved by the HBC: 

“should he ever recover his strength far enough to be capable of undertaking expeditions I think Your Honours may rely on his reports of the situation of any place he may visit.”(HBC, 2016)

                    </p>

                    <p>The same year he was endorsed by Turnor, in the twilight of his apprenticeship term, Thompson was relocated by the HBC back to York Factory while still recovering (HBC, 2016).  In the late summer of 1790, Thompson sent multiple letters to the HBC, the first of which, sent on August 30 was a request for various surveying tools including a sextant.  According to the HBC, during the journey back to York Factory, Thompson put his new skills to the test by making “topographical observations” which he used to make his case to HBC officials in London, asking to work as a surveyor for the Company (HBC, 2016).  As was the case with Turnor, the HBC officials were impressed by Thompson’s work and they obliged his requests, granting him the surveying tools he had asked for, as well as employment as a clerk with a three year term (HBC, 2016).

                    <h2> Career Decisions and Family Life </h2>

                    <p>
                        Several years after becoming a surveyor for the HBC, David Thompson was promoted with the task of overseeing and ensuring the prosperity of a fur trade, his title became that of “Master to the Northward” in 1796 (HBC, 2016).  While this seems like it would have been a positive step in Thompson’s career, he wanted no part in it as surveying was his passion and he felt that he had a great many expeditions in tandem with a great deal of mapmaking yet to come (HBC, 2016).   It was this passion that drove David Thompson to join the North West Company[NWC] and resign from the HBC, the two companies were major opponents in the fur trade market;  officially, he was brought on with great enthusiasm by the NWC at their main office in Grand Portage on the 22nd of July in 1797 (HBC, 2016).  

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        
It would be about two years after he started at the NWC that Thompson would marry Charlotte Small, a Métis woman whom he would build a family with and share the rest of his life and travels with as well (Gilmore, 2015).  Among First Nations customs of marriage, it was typically the case that women married at a younger age than men, usually when they reached sexual maturity, while men married once they were capable of supporting a family (Ward, 2021).   The two were no exception to this, and became married when Thompson was 29, and Small was 13, it was a long and prosperous marriage of 13 children, 58 years, and many expeditions (Gilmore, 2015).  Charlotte Small, like Thompson could speak multiple languages, in her case they were English and Cree as her mother was of Cree descent and her father was a Partner of the NWC (HBC, 2016).

                    </p>


                    <h2>Later Years</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        Thompson would come to retire from his position as a Partner of the NWC in 1812 at the age of 42, and travelled to Terreborne (a settlement to the North of Montreal) where he would first establish a home for his growing family, and use observations from his many travels to create high quality maps (HBC, 2016).  To allow him to complete his work on his various maps, writing and charts, the Partners of the NWC came to an agreement allowing Thompson complete entitlement, for three years, to his portion of the Company’s earnings (as a Partner) in addition to one hundred pounds up front(HBC, 2016).  After several years completing his works in Terreborne, Thompson would relocate to Williamstown (a settlement to the southeast of Ottawa), and after about ten years, the deterioration of his financial situation would begin as his large investments failed him (HBC, 2016).  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It would soon become the case that his observations, work on maps and various writings would be used with no credit nor compensation to him, which occurred after the NWC and HBC were joined, some believe the HBC held a grudge because he had left them (HBC, 2016).  Eventually, he would receive a payment of a mere 150 pounds for his work, which took some complaining, but despite payment, he never received proper credit for his contributions (HBC, 2016).  As the years passed, and he tried to improve his financial situation through writing and surveying, he wrote an atlas and drew maps, which he had submitted in 1843, but was never compensated for this work that he had sent to the British Foreign secretary, and he would also never have them back in his possession (HBC, 2016).

                    <h2>An Unfortunate End</h2>
                    <p class="lastParagraph">
                       Thompson’s remaining years took an unfortunately grim turn, as he never recovered financially, and he could no longer work as a surveyor, which prompted him to begin writing his own memoirs, which he never finished (HBC, 2016).   His situation became so dire that he eventually had no choice, but to sell some of his most beloved belongings, including his tools and even his coat (Gilmore, 2015).  His eyesight worsened and writing became an impossible task, and he passed away poor with no credit for some of his greatest works, a short few months later, his beloved Charlotte would also pass away (Gilmore, 2015).
